# YelpCamp

This project exists as a way to put together front-end and back-end knowledge into a larger full-stack web application.
YelpCamp is a Yelp-style application that allows one to add campgrounds and add comments/reviews similar to other popular review sites.
This application includes authentication (Passport.js) and authorization capabilities.

Further capabilities may be added in the future to allow for more dynamic abilities.
